### 🚀 What Makes This Special?
This isn't just another graph tool. Along with offering powerful graph traversal algorithms, the project features a smooth and secure **Login** and **Signup** system, making sure your data is always safe and sound 🔐. Right now, user data is stored in **LocalStorage**, but don't worry—big plans are on the horizon with **OAuth integration** for easy login via Google and more!

### 🔧 Why You'll Love It
- 💡 **Interactive Graph Creation**: Create custom graphs with just a few clicks! Add nodes and edges, and watch as DFS and BFS algorithms traverse through your data.
- 🔍 **Instant Visual Feedback**: See real-time graph traversal with visual results, so you know exactly how your data is flowing.
- 🖥️ **Full-Stack Powerhouse**: The frontend is built using **Angular** for a seamless experience, while the backend is powered by **Node.js** and **Express.js**, ensuring you get top-notch performance and scalability.

### 🔮 Future Upgrades Await
This is just the beginning! With plans to incorporate advanced algorithms (Dijkstra's, A*) 🧠, user dashboards 📊, and mobile-friendly features 📱, we’re on the path to making this project an indispensable tool for graph lovers everywhere.

## 🚀 How to Set Up and Run the Project

### 🛠️ Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dfs-bfs-graph-traversal.git
cd GRAPH-TRAVERSAL
```

### 🛠️ Step 2: Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 🛠️ Step 3: Navigate to Backend Directory and Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install

Alternatively, you can use **nodemon** for automatic restarts:

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
nodemon server.js
```

### 🛠️ Step 5: Start the Frontend Server

Go back to the project root (`GRAPH-TRAVERSAL`) and run the Angular development server:

```bash
ng serve

## 🔐 Login and Signup Pages

- The **Signup Page** allows users to register by entering a username and password, which is stored in **LocalStorage**.
- The **Login Page** checks credentials against the data stored in LocalStorage.

### 🛠️ How to Access Signup Details from LocalStorage

1. 🖱️ Right-click on the **Signup page** and select **Inspect**.
2. 🧰 Navigate to the **Application** tab in the developer tools.
3. 📂 Under **Storage**, expand **LocalStorage**.
4. 🔍 You’ll find the stored signup details there.

## 🖥️ How the Server Works

The backend server, built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, handles:

- 🛡️ **User Authentication**: A basic registration and login system.
- 🔄 **Graph Traversal**: Provides APIs for DFS and BFS traversals.

## 📊 How the Graph Feature Works

- Input your nodes. **Make sure it is in A,B,... format. Comma is necessary**
- Input your edges. **Make sure it is in the [to]-[from] format. Eg: 0-1**
- Click on **create custom graph** button 🔵
- See how the magic happens
